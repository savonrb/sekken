# Contribution Guide

This page describes how to contribute changes to Sekken.

Please do not create a pull request without reading this guide first.
Make sure to read the documentation for your version at [savonrb.com](http://savonrb.com/)
and post questions to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/savonrb).

**Bug fixes**

If you really think you found a bug, please make sure to add as many information as possible
to the ticket. You're a developer, we are developers and you know we need tests to reproduce
problems and make sure they don't come back.

So if you can reproduce your problem in a spec, that would be awesome! If you can't, please
let us know how we could make this easier for you. Also, provide code and the WSDL of the
service your working with so others can try to come up with a spec for your problem.

After we have a failing spec, it obviously needs to be fixed. Make sure your new spec is the
only failing one under the `spec` directory. CI only runs the "unit tests" at `spec/sekken`,
but Sekken actually has with some additional "integration/example specs" at `spec/integration`,
which you need to run locally to make sure the integration with real world services still works.

Notice that these specs are not run by CI, because the service's are not guaranteed to work
all the time and the specs will timeout after a few seconds when the service is currently down.
